I remember the first day at almost everyone of my jobs. You come in and wait nervously at reception –  feeling like a kid on the first day of school in a new class. You get a little tour of the office, sign some paperwork, and get shown to your desk. That's it. You're onboarded. Maybe you go over the employee handbook or even get taken out to lunch by your new manager, but you feel wildly on your own – nervously waiting for someone from your new team to have time to walk you through your first assignments.

## Onboarding is broken
Why is new employee onboarding a task of human resources? Shouldn't introducing a new team member to the company be the responsibility of the entire company? It takes a village to raise a child. Should companies follow the same ethos bringing on new team members?

Onboarding is so much more than filling out tax forms and signing up for benefits – it is a new hire's first 90 days at your company. Whether those first 90 days are carefully planned or completely unguided, the experiences they encounter will shape their relationship with you, their new employer.

Coming in to a new job is a daunting thing. Mixed feelings of nervous excitement and lingering doubts fill the heads of everyone in the early days at a new job. I recall clearly the feeling of not having specific direction on what to do next or what to work on. Meanwhile, my manager is in meetings all day and doesn't a moment to walk me through their expectations. Am I doing what's expected of me? Should I be taking more on? Figuring out myself? Was this a mistake? Do they think hiring me was a mistake? It's not a great way to start a relationship.

[25% of employees don't feel connected to their company's mission.](https://www.octanner.com/insights/articles/2018/9/14/an_onboarding_checkl.html){:target="_blank"}. Those first 90 days can make new hire tuck their tail and run or it can turn a hired mercenary into a diehard loyalist, waving the company flag, completely bought in to your company's vision.

## So what is Lizzy going to do about it?
1. We are going to give you the tools to get every department involved in employee onboarding - building processes and collaborating with other departments.
2. We are going to give your employees one place to review, consume, and understand the specific tasks that are expected of them so they know exactly what's expected of them and when.
3. We are going to make it easy to create, document, and evolve your onboarding processes. It will be easy to make changes globally as well as create specific tasks only applicable to certain roles, and everything in between.

## We can do this
We think companies have an opportunity to foster a culture of trust, transparency, and growth. It starts with really excellent onboarding. We're excited to go on this journey with you.
