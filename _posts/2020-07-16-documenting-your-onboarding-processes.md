Our processes are as good as we document them to be. The hours upon hour we spend building lists, making tweaks, and running through the edge cases are wasted if we don't document that knowledge so others can find it (or so you'll remember it 5 minutes after the thought came to you).

## Good documentation is easily found
There's an old expression that goes "if a tree falls in the woods, can you find where it documented its processes?". I might have that wrong... never-the-less, if you get hit by a bus tomorrow, can your team function without you? Or what if you just wanted to take a vacation without being bombarded with calls and email while you're gone? Do they know where to look to find the trove of knowledge you've taken the time to document for them went?

If your company doesn't do this already, get together with the department heads and make a plan. It seems a little absurd but documenting where everything is documented can make things easier to find in the future. Link to every department's documentation and write a blurb about why and how things are documented. Create patterns that can be repeated. Whether you're moving on from this world (or just going to the beach for a week), having instructions on where to find documentation and how to contribute to it will save you a lot of headaches.

## Good documentation is idiot (and genius) proof
I am sure that everyone you work with is incredibly competent but it's always good to plan for worst case scenarios. Your documentation should be designed like railroad tracks to guide anyone who reads it along all of the needed stops.

It's also good to keep in mind that you are bound to have your documentation found by someone (a real genius) who thinks they are too smart to follow your steps. They've got it all figured out and will do things as they see fit. Identify the common pitfalls in your processes that can easily arise so you can include necessary troubleshooting steps to get back on track.

## Good documentation is flexible
If you're documenting a specific process, consider other processes it is similar to. Can you identify common steps or themes between the two processes? We humans love our patterns and habits. If you can create commonÂ  motifs in your documentation it makes documenting new processes far easier.

It also makes consuming new processes faster if you know the order of operations and can anticipate what type of steps are next. Think about recipes - you're almost always going to see the list of ingredients first (after the blogger's autobiography of course..."I grew on a small hobby farm outside of Albuquerque..."), followed by prep instructions, and the baking/cooking instructions. We find comfort in knowing what to expect next.

## Good documentation is maintainable and easily changed
I wouldn't advise etching your documentation on stone tablets (literally or proverbially). You're going to run into situations where your team will change project management tools, email providers, or something else that will cause you to have to make changes in any number of spots. Ideally, having a tool that allows you to swap out shared steps in one spot goes a long way in maintaining integrity in your docs. If you do find yourself having to manually change each location a common step is used, it's good to have a, you guessed it, process to ensure all of your documentation get's the changes across the board and isn't splintered with contradictory documentation.

## How could Lizzy help? (Shameless plug)
One reason we made Lizzy is because we identified that it's really hard to main complex process documentation in a manner that keeps everything organized. For example if you onboarding documentation for six teams and a year later your tooling changes, you have to go back to all six to update that changes, otherwise your processes splinter and are no longer accurate. We enable you to change the process in one spot and everyone receives the change. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:cole@meetlizzy.com){:target="_blank"} for a demo if you're curious to learn more!
