Onboarding new hires is more than filling out paperwork. Transform your onboarding process by incorporating humanity into your process

## 1. Meet everyone in the company
It might seem novel that every new person should meet every employee in your company, but remember that when Jeff Weiner took the helm at LinkedIn, [he met each one of his 330 employees](https://usbusinessinside.blogspot.com/2019/11/linkedin-ceo-jeff-weiner-met-330.html){:target="_blank"}. This may not work for every company depending on the size of your organization, but what's at the heart of this concept? Our goal is to ensure that every new employees feels connected and ingrained in the company culture. Additionally, meeting everyone right a way builds the foundation of a relationship with everyone so it's easier to reach out when they have a question or need help.

## 2. Have coffee with the CEO
What better way to align with the company mission than speak with the person directing it? If a CEO's job is to guide the company, then taking 20 minutes to meet with new employees allows them to build grass roots support and ensure everyone feels connected to the "why" from the start.

## 3. Set up tools and equipment with IT
Your new employees are excited to get to work. Nothing is more painful than to join a company and sit around and wait for IT to set up their computer and get the right software installed. Have new employees sit down with IT, walk through the system and make sure everything is ready to go. First, it gives new hires an open door to ask questions they might be nervous to reach out and ask otherwise. It also builds a quick relationship with your IT team so there is a familiarity there.Â  Lastly, and probably most importantly, it ensures from day one that they have the tools they need to do the job.

## 4. A bite sized project
Giving new hires a bite sized project early on has a lot of pros. It's something quickly achievable to instill confidence. It gives them a chance to get their feet wet early and test out their equipment, talk to the team, get feedback, etc. There's just something magical about jumping in and being productive right away.

## 5. Goal setting with managers
We all feel better when we know exactly what is expected of us, especially from our managers. It might feel like jumping the gun a bit, but having new employees discuss goals with their managers as part of the onboarding process will build a foundation of mutual trust and transparency between the two individuals, resulting in a strong team culture.
