When thinking about your employee onboarding experience, it’s important to get team managers involved so when new hires cross the chasm from “HR paperwork land” to “new team manage land”, they have a set of tasks that make that transition smooth and keeps them engaged and integrated into their new team.

## “Isn’t that your job?”

“I thought HR took care of onboarding.” Have you heard that one? Before we jump down anyone’s throat I think it’s fair to realize that many don’t fully understand the extent of what onboarding new employees is.

So many are still stuck on the idea that onboarding paperwork and registering for benefits, but I believe. Educating our teams that onboarding is a responsibility we all share is the first step in building better onboarding experiences.

## Sell them on the benefits

It helps to give some real world, tangible reasons to gain their support. Educating them on the [cost of bad onboarding](/blog/the-cost-of-bad-employee-onboarding){:target="_blank"}
 can be eye opening.

When we think about marketing funnels, the quickest way to improve the bottom line is to [plug up the leaks in the bottom of the funnel](https://www.shopify.com/blog/conversion-funnel-leaks){:target="_blank”}, so what if we thought about hiring the same way? Instead of continually hiring new employees to fill the vacancies left by exiting employees, what if we found a way to keep employees around longer?

## Give them a framework to develop their processes

The thought of putting pen to paper on your processes can be daunting, but providing a framework can go a long ways in making it easier to get over the hump.

Start by identifying a team that would be a good candidate to build the first process with and plan that first team’s plan together. When you feel like you have all of the steps sorted figured, take a look back and deconstruct them by the purpose they serve (i.e. tooling, education, culture, etc).

These deconstructions start to shape your framework for moving on to another team. You can now ask yourself what tasks are analogous to the tasks for the previous team, etc.

You’ll find after rinsing and repeating this method that patterns will emerge and the findings from one team might influence another team’s process.

I previous wrote about [documenting your onboarding process](/blog/documenting-your-onboarding-processes){:target="_blank"} which gets more into the mechanics of building and maintaining your processes which might be worth checking out.

## Shifting a culture through onboarding

Culture change is one hardest things to do in an and it takes a long time, but if we can find opportunities like imparting values and good habits to every new employees through onboarding, we can shape a culture from the get-go.
