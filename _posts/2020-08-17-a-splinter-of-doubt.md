I remember sitting down at my new desk for the first time of the new job I had just started – so excited yet so unsure. If you made a line chart graphing my certainty this would have been the lowest trough.

When I started my job search and found this opportunity I applied thinking my chances were slim to none so when I got the call for the first interview I was so excited – they picked _me_. This is probably the highest point in the graph of certainty.

Once I began the interview process I was still excited about the role, but I started seeing the imperfections in the culture, personalities I could see myself clashing with, and all the other flaws you notice when you’re up close and personality.

Looking back I think this phase of uncertainty and doubt is a really positive thing for companies and prospective employees. It’s important for interviewees to force themselves to question whether a role is a good fit instead of charging ahead blindly.

## My first day

So why was I so nervous – so uncertain? Well first off it was all new. Any new job is a lot to take in for even the most experienced professional. Sitting in the lobby like a kid on first day of school – thinking about what I would have been doing at my last job at that moment. It’s hard not to compare.

As I was being shown around the office my confidence was rising again. I was reminded how cool the office was, how friendly the people were – it felt like this could work out.

I was brought to my desk where my computer waited for me and told by my manager that we’d meet soon to get me up to speed. So I sat down, got logged in to my email and started browsing Slack.

I’ve never been one to sit still – I always need to be working on and towards something, so feeling like I was just wasting time drove me nuts. And this where the certainty graph bottomed out. “What was I doing? I have nothing to do and no one to tell me what to work on.”

A splinter of doubt was planted.

## Setting expectations

That tiny seed of doubt deepens and grows faster than we’d like it to, especially when left unchecked. I believe we can take those opportunities of fear and uncertainty and give support and a path in the form of expectations. While to some that may not sound like much but imagine how you would feel had you just started and someone said “this is exactly what you need to be doing and when”. It would feel like a gift to be given a playbook to follow.
